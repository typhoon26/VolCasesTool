### ðŸ“Š Scenario Analysis Tool for Options

This is a **Scenario Analysis Tool** built specifically for **Options**.

We operate within the constraints of a **Proprietary Trading Firm**, and have found that existing tools such as **CME Direct** (for US markets) are insufficient for managing options risk effectively.

Most of these platforms only provide **ATM volatility adjustments**, but in practice, **Skew Risk Management** is just as importantâ€”especially during potential **volatility spikes** like those observed on **Liberation Day**.

#### ðŸ“¥ Input Format

The tool accepts input in the form of an `.xlsx` file containing **live streaming volatility data**.
